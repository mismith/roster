Roster IO
========================

Quickly poll your team roster's availability.


## TODO

- enable custom reminder email times
- improve loading screen
- send email (+ notif) to existing user when added to new roster
- send email to roster members on event day to notify them
- add local notifications for reminders (including push notifications for home screen apps?)
- shareable urls on event pages
- hide past events behind click
- in dialogs, clone edited object so cancellable changes aren't visible locally
- fix dialog loading icon issues and error handling
- fix buggy fast scrolling on mobile
- fix page loading flicker (by caching results and/or resolving?)
- fix toast position on android
- auto-accept invites if invited user's email logs in (and not necessarily to accept that invite)
